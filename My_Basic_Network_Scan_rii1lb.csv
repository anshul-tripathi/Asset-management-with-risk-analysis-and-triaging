20007,,7.1,High,192.168.1.1,tcp,443,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

                This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
                <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

                Configuration Overview
        </div>
        <div class=""content_section_text"">
          <p>
                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled

                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.

                           <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or
intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.",n/a,,"Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

successful because the authentication protocol service was available

protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that

291, 8 Update 281, 11 Update 10, or 15 Update 2. It is, therefore, affected by an information disclosure vulnerability
as referenced in the January 2021 CPU advisory. Specifically, an unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain unauthorized
read access to some data accessible to Java SE and Java SE Embedded. Only Java deployments that load and run untrusted
code and rely on the Java sandbox for security are affected. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
